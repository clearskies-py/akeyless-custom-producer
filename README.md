# Clearskies Akeyless Custom Producer

This clearskies module provides endpoins for building custom producers and rotators in Akeyless.

Akeyless docs:

* <https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/custom-producer>
* <https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/create-a-custom-rotated-secret>

NOTE: these are the bindings for building your own custom Akeyless dynamic producers/rotators.  There is also a (slowly) building library of ready-made custom dynamic producers.  Those are kept in a separate github org just to avoid clutter in the main clear-skies space.  You can find them here:
